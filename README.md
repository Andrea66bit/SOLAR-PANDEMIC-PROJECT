Story of how your project was inspired
Technology & Architecture
Core algorithms and code snippet
Discussion of process, collaboration and timeline
Challenge(s) overcome
Live Demo
Learnings about technical interests as a result of this project
Time to answer questions from the audience
Feedback and comments provided by technical staff, possibly alum guests
The length of time for a presentation will be 18 minutes

You will have 2 minutes setup, 8 minutes to present followed by 8 min Q&A.
